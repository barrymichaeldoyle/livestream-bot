# Roulette

Normal roulette rules.
Each player can make as many bets as they want during the spin.
Spins starts at random intervals by the bot.
Players will have 2 mins to bet.
Bot will count down from 10 (and maybe say other intervals - like 1 min, 30 sec - as well)
Bot will private message players to confirm their bets.
Use !r command for roulette bets E.g. !r odd 100 etc.
At the end, the bot will announce the results.
Also private message how points were calculated.
Then restart the random timer interval. Every between 10 mins and 1 hour.
